<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The idea behind the rEvolver program was to provide an engine
wherein to have fun with, and learn about genetic programming, as well
as expanding our understanding of many different software construction
and programming language concepts.  In rEvolver we generate
"Creatures", which are vehicle for running DNA (a small, lambda
calculus based program).  The DNA language is generated from a grammer
like specification, and interpretted by a slightly modified CSE
machine.  The CSE machine interpretter was modified to allow
continuations, which we use to allow programs to be paused for a
while.  This pausing of creature dna, allows us to interleave creature
actions and simulate things taking time in our system. </p>

<h2>Creature Language (DNA) and Generation</h2>

<p>Our DNA language was based upon the lambda calculus and was built
strongly in the principal of providing the bare minimum resources for
interesting code. We started with abstraction ops {lambda and gamma},
list operations {cons, car and cdr}, boolean functions{or, if, },and
environment functions{move, look, feed, and energy}.  After getting
all of these operations in order, we also added </p>
